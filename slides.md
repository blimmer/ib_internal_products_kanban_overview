## Agenda
* History
* Four tenants of Kanban
* How our process differs from true Kanban

---

:rocket:

**we only have 10 minutes**

---

## History
* inventory control system pioneered by Toyota
* english translation ~= "queue limit"
* match inventory to demand

---

## Four tenants of Kanban
1. Visualize Work
1. Limit Work in Progress
1. Focus on Flow
1. Continuous Improvement

***

## 1. Visualize Work

if work is visible, you can see blockers, bottlenecks and queues immediately.

## 1. Visualize Work

usually the first step when a team is just moving to Kanban, just get the work visualized with **no other changes**.

1. Limit Work in Progress
1. Focus on Flow
1. Continuous Improvement

***

## 2. Limit Work in Progress
assign limits to each column in your visualized workflow

---

## Why Limit Work in Progress?

* context switching requires neurological warm-up
* multiple things in progress == no full attention on one task
* no limits to WIP means drain on you and your teammates

---

> Juggling simultaneous work doesnâ€™t make you more productive. It just makes you more distracted.

---

## What if we hit the WIP limit?

* stop doing work that adds to or exceeds the WIP limit
* help teammates with other in progress work
* PR review (maybe outside your team??)
* planning

***

## 3. Focus on Flow
monitor and report the flow of work through the newly WIP-limited workflow

---

## Metrics to Observe

* WIP limits (never hit? exceeded often?)
* Queues (where does work build up waiting to be pulled to the next lane?)
* Blockers (how often do things get blocked?)
* Lead Time (story from idea => finish)
* Cycle Time (story from start dev => finish dev)
* Flow Diagrams

---

# wat?

## What the Metrics Really Mean

all of these metrics ask one question:

how do we improve :wavy_dash: **flow** :wavy_dash: ?

## 4. Continuous Improvement

it's a lifestyle

---

## 4. Continuous Improvement

* paying attention to the metrics can help drive incremental efficiency
* tweak WIP limits
* try new strategies to manage blockers, testing, acceptance, etc.
  * metrics will tell you if it worked or not

# How our Process Differs

---

## How our Process Differs

well, we're not doing kanban really. :laughing:

---

## How our Process Differs
* pointing stories
* no WIP limits (*)
* sprints
* pivotal tracker does not support true kanban boards

---

## Things we can do
* talk about a WIP limit on in-progress stories
* consider story acceptance a "queue" with a WIP limit
* track metrics for cycle time on tickets between sprints
* epic labels for "columns" with WIP limits

---
